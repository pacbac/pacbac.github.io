I also performed sensitivity analysis (adjusting parameters and analyzing how the model behaved upon these changes) to verify credibility of each model. <br/>This was one of the models that won 2nd place (Alpha Prize) out of 120+ teams in AoCMM 2018 Math Modeling Competition.",

        "details": "I worked in a team of three to provide a mathematical analysis of the energy profiles of certain states in the US based on data from 1960 to 2009, provided by the US Energy Information Administration. I helped to implement the model, which predicts the energy usage of the states up to 40 years. As a team, we wrote a paper that explained the approach of the model and the findings. This was made for the Mathematical Contest in Modeling 2018, which we received an honorable mention in.",
